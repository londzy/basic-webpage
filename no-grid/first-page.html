  <p>Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge
is the world’s longest and highest brigde, its really looks scary and terifying well that my kind of fun. you can have a brand new experience on the Glass Bridge to look down of the verdant view on the transparent glass floor. the very long and steep walk way, super narrow way at Yixiantian, and other beautiful natural scenery will take you to tour in excitement, enjoyment,<p>
